Biomedical Engineering final year project - Development of Electromyography Monitor for Physiological Stress Detection on the Trapezius Muscle

In the fast-evolving world, due to the aging of the population as well as the creation of more office jobs, there is a significant increase in musculoskeletal disorder.
Over the span of seven months, the student successfully developed and designed a device for physiological stress monitoring on the trapezius muscle using surface Electromyography (EMG), in order to provide accurate and sufficient indication for physiological stress.
The EMG signals are obtained using disposable gelled electrodes from the trapezius muscle group, which is located just below the neck. For signal acquisition in this project, NI LabVIEW and MyDAQ device are used. Siganl processing was performed in Matlab in the time domain and frequency domain, time-frequency domain was also attempted.
